 Project Structure**

```
LibraryApp.java      # Main application file
books.dat            # Serialized book data
members.dat          # Serialized member data
loans.dat            # Serialized loan data

 Installation & Setup**

1. **Install Java**

   * Make sure Java JDK 8 or later is installed.
   * Check version:

     ```bash
     java -version
     javac -version
     ```

2. **Download Source Code**

   * Save `LibraryApp.java` to a folder.

3. **Compile the Application**

   ```bash
   javac LibraryApp.java
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   ```bash

 How It Works**

* **On Startup:** Reads `.dat` files into in-memory lists.
* **When Adding / Editing / Deleting:** Updates the in-memory list and saves to file.
* **Issue Book:** Checks availability, reduces count, creates loan record.
* **Return Book:** Increases available count, updates return date, calculates fine.
* **Search:** Filters in-memory data without affecting files.
